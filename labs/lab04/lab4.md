    It is important to choose a license for any open source project because this means your project will fall under
    default copyright law. This means that only you would have the right to replicate, distribute, and edit your work.
    This defeats the purpose of open source as people will be unwilling to help with your project because of the 
    uncertainty with your lack of license. Alternatively, some open source code that you might want to use within your own 
    project may have licenses that require that any derivative work must use a permissive license as well and default 
    copyright law would not fall under that.

    You shouldn't use a project that doesn't have a license because the uncertainty of the license means that the project 
    leader could claim your work at any time. Since it falls under default copyright law that means that you dont have the 
    right to use or distribute any of the code. This means your project could grind to a hault or have major set backs 
    because of this.

    I would agree with the claims being made about why Gopher lost to the Web. I think the biggest factor was the ease of 
    browse that they mentioned within this write up. And this ease of use brought in a lot more people to using the Web 
    over Gopher. And this lead to more people working and  upgrading the infrastructure of the Web over Gopher. This 
    meant that the Web was developing much faster than Gopher leading to a runaway effect. And ultimately lead to the 
    Web's take over of Gopher.

    It makes sense that Android uses Apache license and GPL v2 for its kernel since Android has had its history and goal 
    within open source. The whole goal for Android was to create a operating system for phones that made it easy to 
    modify the phone to the user's preferences.
