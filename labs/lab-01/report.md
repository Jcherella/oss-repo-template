# Lab 01 Report - Introduction to Open Source Software

# 6. 10 Open Source Definition:
	The importance of this definition is to make sure that there is a freedom to the code/project.
	That there isnt many restrictions on how the source code is used, modified, and provided.

# 7. Smart Questions:
	1.Try to see what the person knows already
	2.Make sure you detail your steps to the solutions

# 8. Free Culture:
	The biggest thing that I got out of the reading was the unintended consequences that you have to deal with
	when developing. Just as the story shows, Jesse set out with the goal of better connecting his school's
	intranetwork. He brought on the assistence of a officially developed Microsoft software to help with his endeavor
	and only made minor fixes. However, it had publically shared folders in which students used to share music files. 
	Since he did nothing to remedy this issue, he was approached with a law suit which would not be easy to get out of. It shows
	that you have to be careful in every aspect of developing anything and need to think how your software could be used
	maliciously or exploited for illegal use.
